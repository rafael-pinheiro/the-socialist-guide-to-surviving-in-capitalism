Hey you. Yes, you!

You want Capitalism gone?

Good.

But let’s face it, unless every discord shitposter with an anime avatar gets equipped
with a t-34, the downfall of the biggest system ever built isn’t going to be happening any
day soon. At least not in the west.

That’s why we introduce the well-rounded, and not in any way based on mine and my audience’s
personal experience - the all encompassing - Socialist’s guide to surviving in Capitalism.
While we can easily blame almost everything on Capitalism, unironically, I don’t have
enough time to go through every aspect of life which the system damages.

Why?

Because I can’t dedicate my full time due to having a job, because of Capitalism,
unironically.

So, in order to keep this concise for all you wonderful pill popping anxiety ridden
no attention span having tovarischi - we will cut it into 3 parts:
- WORK
- MONEY SPENDING
- STAYING MOTIVATED

Some of these might not apply to your conditions, and you should not look at them as being the
be all and end all approaches to the aspects of life defined previously.

Others will make you go "isn't that obvious?". Well, for some it might not be.

The only thing this manifesto is trying to do is share some experience, mistakes and lessons
me and different comrades have had.

Wanting a better world does not mean we should live the one life we have in misery. Get outta here with that liberal moralism.
