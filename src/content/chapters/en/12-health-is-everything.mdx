No job or education is worth sacrificing it.

Quite literally.

I’m not trying to be a hippy here - if you break your back over a job that barely pays
the average wage - the damage done to your mind or body will end up costing you far more
in the future.

Unless you are being directly abused, never change your job before you find an alternative.
I’m sure we’ve all dreamt of just quitting like they do in the movies - but if you don’t
have money saved, and no debt - that could be a fatal mistake.

Plus - many people in HR have a thing against employing someone who says they’re "currently between jobs on the interview".

Just don’t shoot yourself in the foot is what I’m saying.
