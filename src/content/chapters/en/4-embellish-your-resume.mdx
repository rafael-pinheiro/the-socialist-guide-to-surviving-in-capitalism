Embellish your work experience during interviews.

Sometimes straight up lie.

Job requirements nowadays are so high, especially in the beginning of a career that if you were
to choose not to lie, you’ll most likely be the only one during the interview process
who did so.

Don’t be that guy.

You’re not that guy.
