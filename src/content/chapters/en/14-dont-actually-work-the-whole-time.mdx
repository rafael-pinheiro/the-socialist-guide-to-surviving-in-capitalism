Never quit your job to start a new one before all transitional documentation has been signed.

Companies go back on promises of employment regularly.

It might say it's an 8h work day, with 1h worth of break time, but If there are no strict
systems of time keeping available at your workplace then stretch it out as much as you
can.

Work hard for half a day and spend the rest relaxing - whenever possible.
