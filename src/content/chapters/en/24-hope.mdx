Staying a motivated anti-capitalist isn’t an easy task.

The system pushes you to sell out at every corner, and your past ignorance towards how
the world works feels like a comfortable position you sometimes yearn to go back to.

As the political climate seems dangerously doomerpilled - we take any sunshine that we
can get.

A military coup being defeated here - or some additional healthcare there - but deep down
inside our yearning for true freedom feels out of reach and distant.

But then again - is it really?

There’s 2 fish in a barrel - one of them thinks it’s the ocean - the other one knows
it’s trapped in a barrel local drunkards offten piss in.

Realistically they’re both in the same situation - and the first - dumb fish - arguably has
a far greater chance of being what is commonly defined as happier.

But the second one - in it’s knowledge of the circumstances which it found itself in has something far more valuable than ignorant happiness.
It knows that the rules she was always told about - were supposed to apply to the ocean a thing, just like success in capitalism - which she might never see . And with this
knowledge she can swim with far more purpose an elegance in a barrel than an ignorant one
could in a planet of oceans.

True freedom means looking into and questioning the presuppositions of everything which is
given to us by the hegemonic ideology.

Questioning even freedom itself and never abandoning the struggle.
