Insist on talking about salaries with people you're organizing or working with.

The only person winning when wages aren’t discussed amongst employees is the employer.

They have all the information on you but you are rarely given transparency into how the
business is run.

The first step in taking back some power is when you know just how much you’re being
underpaid.
