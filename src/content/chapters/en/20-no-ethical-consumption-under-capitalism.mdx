This eternal truth should preserve you from assuming you have almost any impact on the
global environmental crisis.

Because you don’t.

So don’t feel guilty about it.

That said though - when possible and affordable - you lose nothing by trying to live a more
sustainable life.

Sometimes it could even give you hopeful purpose, which isn’t all that bad in this grim dark
world of ours.

Maintain your home, car, and more expensive items - the price for upkeep is always lower
than the price you’ll have to pay to fix it.

Many manufacturers are making more money on fixing their broken or defunct products than
actually selling them.
