Use public transportation when possible, it’s cheaper and often faster.

Try your local union for a loan before going to a bank.

Balance out food quality and price because saving on food today means paying the doctor tomorrow.

Treat yourself whenever possible, while at the same time following the rules above.

Help homeless people. Like seriously.
Give them some change and don’t question what they’ll be spending it on.
They have enough problems as is.

Don’t buy self help bullshit or follow gurus which conveniently want to sell you 5000$ studying packages.

There.is.no.easy.way.out.of.the.system.
Either cheat it, work it, or suffer under it.

And finally there is no guilt in living a good life as long as it is not at the expense of others.

As class conscious individuals we shouldn’t feel jealousy toward members of our own class
who were a bit luckier, as we risk to alienate them from the cause - and if we end up being
the lucky ones we must strive to never loose the class consciousness which most likely
led us to the place in life we are in.

After savings - whatever you have left that you do not need - if possible - donate to
socialist projects you believe in.

And if you have actual time on your hands - participate in them or create your own.

Mutual aid, food donation kitchens, and direct action in general are perfectly lovely places
to start.
