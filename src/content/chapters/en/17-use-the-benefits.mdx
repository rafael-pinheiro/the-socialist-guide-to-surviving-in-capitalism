Use all your job benefits to the fullest, and always remember even with them included you're being underpaid.

For example your workplace gives you x amount of money per week for gas and you don't use it?
Fill up your mom's car.

These only scratch the surface but basically boil down to the following: You need to remember
that your worth is not based on your job title or pay.

Youâ€™re a human, not an asset for your boss.

Distance your personal identity with that of the firm, or it will swallow you up before
you know it.

All those corporate drones you avoid at parties?

Well - believe it or not they used to be real people like you before a brand replaced their
soul - and linkedin became their guru.
