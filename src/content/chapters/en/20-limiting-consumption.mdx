Systemic alienation leads us into an eternal search for easy and
quick fixes for our inherent unhappiness.

While substance abuse and mental health have thankfully become mainstream topics of discussion,
addiction to consumerism has not.

Marx wrote that alienation made it possible for us to seek to meet our human needs in
such a distorted way that a whole range of products which are completely unnecessary
and even harmful become central to a sense of self worth.

Pinpointing the reasoning behind your drive to continuously purchase new and new and new
and new things can do a lot of good for your wallet and your health.

Differentiate consumption for need, and consumption that makes you feel good for a couple of hours because if the latter dominates your buying habits - you’re deeper into the consumerist
rabbit hole than you think.

To all according to their need - is what daddy Marx said - so follow it and limit how much
extra money capitalists make selling you shit you really don’t have any use for.

This isn’t the conscious buying shtick high end eco friendly companies want to sell you
on - but a simple approach to a big problem - questioning why you’re buying something
before you buy it.
