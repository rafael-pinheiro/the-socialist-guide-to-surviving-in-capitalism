I will get shit for this one but I have to say it - If you have enough capital do try and escape renting.

It’s unstable and insecure, no matter how many arguments are made in favor of it by
Capitalists.

Without your own personal home - you are always at risk of greater exploitation by the system,
the banks and your work place.

It’s extremely difficult to get a home nowadays - but I repeat - if possible - do escape putting
food on your landlord’s leechy dinner table.

Chances are your rent is higher than their bloody mortgage for the place.
