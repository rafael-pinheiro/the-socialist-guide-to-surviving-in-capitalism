Ching ching you just made a few bucks, life isn't bad, the sun is shining.

You managed to pay off some of your debt, or if you're lucky actually save a few bucks.

Good for you.

Now prepare to be bombarded by thousands of carefully designed advertising campaigns telling
you what you need.

When you need it and how much of it you need.

Get ready to have your very identity molded by how you spend your money.

Get ready to be a consoomer.

And, honestly, it's kind of unavoidable at this point.

We are all products of the systems and culture we live in and the Socialist is not here to
preach some high and mighty liberal notion of modesty to you.

To the contrary let's try and quickly go through different spending habits which Capitalism
encourages which just leave you wasting your hard earned money.
