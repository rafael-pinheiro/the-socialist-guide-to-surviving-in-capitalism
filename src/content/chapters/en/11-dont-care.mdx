Don’t care so much.

Literally.

This is not your business, you’re not an owner, and it’s much bigger than you.
Whenever you see them not listening to your ideas for improvement don’t get defensive
and make enemies.

If their approach to whatever task fails - use it - politely - as an argument for your case
in the future.

But never ruin your relationship with your colleagues or managers because the company
leadership chooses to do stupid things - most likely they’re just following orders like
you.

At the end of the day do you really care if your company sells 50 000 diapers a day or
51 000 diapers a day?

No, you don’t.

So stop taking yourself so seriously.

Your identity is NOT linked to that of the workplace.
