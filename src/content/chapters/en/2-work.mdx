Your employer, no matter how nice, or mean, will never be able to afford paying you
the worth of your work.

In this system, profit is what drives them, and even if they attempted to step out of
it and support you fully they would go bankrupt or lose to competition.

Therefore you are not only in competition with your employer’s competitors but with
your employer themselves.

You owe them nothing - but to the contrary - they owe you.

By not paying you enough on what you deliver daily, they exist as a direct anti-thesis to
your thesis.
