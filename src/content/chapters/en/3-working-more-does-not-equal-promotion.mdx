Don’t overwork yourself.

Thousands of data points and statistics show us that the employee who stays extra hours,
doesn’t take days of, and is extremely loyal to one employer does not end up getting promoted.

Work - just enough - and then oversell it - the same way your employer oversells work
benefits to you.
