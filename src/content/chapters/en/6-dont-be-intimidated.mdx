Don’t be scared - you can learn most skills when you start the new job, as long as you’re
not a doctor, pilot or an engineer or something.

There are tutorials on literally everything - and yes - you can learn from them.

If paid education programs exist at your workplace - take them - but if they’re making you
pay for them save your money and learn the skill yourself.
